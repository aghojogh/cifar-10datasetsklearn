# CIFAR-10 Dataset Classification by Basic Machine Learning

An image classifier using basic machine learning (scikit-learn) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, featuring data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization with Python machine learning libraries.

I use logsitic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (MLP) for classification.
